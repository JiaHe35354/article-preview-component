## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

Through building this Article Preview Component, Iâ€™ve deepened my understanding and improved my skills in the following areas:

#### DOM Manipulation with JavaScript

- I practiced selecting and manipulating elements using querySelector().

- I learned how to toggle CSS classes dynamically using .classList.toggle() to change styles and visibility based on user interaction.

- I used .classList.add() and .classList.remove() to explicitly control the state of elements, ensuring more predictable behavior.

#### Responsive Behavior with JavaScript + Media Queries

- I implemented different interactions for desktop and mobile screens using JavaScript and window.innerWidth.

- I learned how to adapt behavior conditionally depending on screen size, such as hiding and showing specific elements (e.g., showing the mobile share icon or hiding the desktop button on smaller screens).

#### Dynamic Styling and State Management

- I used CSS classes (like .icon-white, .btn-darker, .hide, and .show-popup) to visually reflect the appâ€™s state.

- I learned how to manage multiple elements (like changing icon color or hiding a button) together to create a seamless user experience.

There are some code snippets I'm proud of:

```css
@media (max-width: 37.5em) {
  /* Set .text-box to position: relative so the absolutely positioned .popup is correctly placed on mobile screens */
  .text-box {
    position: relative;
  }

  .share-container {
    position: unset;
  }

  .popup {
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    transform: translate(0, 0);
    width: 100%;
    height: 7.6rem;
    padding: 0 3rem;
    border-radius: 0;
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 8px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 8px;

    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    background: var(--dark-grayish-blue);
  }

  .popup .arrow-down {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

```js
function showDesktopPopup() {
  popup.classList.toggle("show-popup");
  btnShareDesktop.classList.toggle("btn-darker");
  iconShareDesk.classList.toggle("icon-white");
}

function showMobilePopup() {
  popup.classList.toggle("show-popup");
  btnShareDesktop.classList.add("hide");
  btnShareMobile.classList.add("btn-darker");
  iconShareMobile.classList.add("icon-white");
}

btnShareDesktop.addEventListener("click", function () {
  if (window.innerWidth <= 600) {
    showMobilePopup();
  } else {
    showDesktopPopup();
  }
});
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving my understanding of JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation, especially in creating responsive interactions for different screen sizes.
Additionally, I want to get more comfortable using media queries to create smooth, responsive designs and explore how JavaScript can adapt functionality based on screen width more efficiently.
